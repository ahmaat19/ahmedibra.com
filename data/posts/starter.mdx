Oops, I did it again! I'm writing another book, and it's again about TypeScript. I'm happy to announce *The TypeScript Cookbook*, to be published in 2023 by O'Reilly. You can check it out in Early Release on the [O'Reilly website](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/typescript-cookbook/9781098136642/).

```js
cosole.log('Hello world!')
```

A couple of months ago I have been contacted by Amanda Quinn from O'Reilly. She has read my articles and seen my book [TypeScript in 50 Lessons](https://typescript-book.com/).
